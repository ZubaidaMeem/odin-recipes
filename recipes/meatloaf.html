        <li> 1 rib celery, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>½ medium onion, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>½ medium red bell pepper, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>4 white mushrooms, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>2 ½ pounds ground chuck</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>large egg, beaten</li>
        <li> teaspoon dried Italian herbs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup plain bread crumbs</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Glaze Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Sriracha sauce, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a baking dish with lightly greased foil.</li>
        <li>Place carrot, celery, onion, bell pepper, mushrooms, and garlic in a food processor; pulse until very finely
            chopped,<br>almost to a purée. Transfer to a large mixing bowl. </li>
        <li>Add ground chuck to the vegetables, along with Worcestershire sauce, egg, Italian herbs, salt,
            black pepper, <br>and cayenne. Mix gently with a wooden spoon until ingredients are just combined.
            Sprinkle in bread crumbs <br>and gently mix with your fingertips until just combined;
            don't overmix. </li>
        <li>Shape the mixture into a loaf, about 4 inches high by 6 inches across.
            Place in the prepared baking pan. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven just until the meatloaf is hot, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, stir brown sugar, ketchup, Dijon, and Sriracha for glaze in a small bowl until
            brown sugar has dissolved. </li>
        <li>Remove meatloaf from the oven. Spoon glaze on the top of the meatloaf with the back of a spoon,
            then pull a tiny <br>bit glaze down the sides. </li>
        <li>Return to the oven, and bake until no longer pink inside, 45 to 75 more minutes. An instant-read
            thermometer inserted <br>into the thickest part of the loaf should read at least 160 degrees F
            (70 degrees C), so start checking at 45 minutes <br>and continue baking until meatloaf reaches that
            temperature. Cooking time will depend on shape and thickness of the meatloaf. </li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy! </li>
    </ol>
